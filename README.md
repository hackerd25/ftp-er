# FTP-er

Ftp-er is a python script for making ftp servers. 

## For what it can be used
You can use it for file transferring files , CTF-s and whatever you want to, but if you use it for illegal stuff i am not having any responsibility.
## How to use it
The program will say what it wants like parameters.
## For committers
Anybody who collaborates and helps with this code will be part of Algh√òr1thm. There we will make security and pen testing tools in a public repository. I will later probably make a site for it. Idk
## Warning!!!
Always be careful not to be hacked by forgetting about a sever you ran and people accessing your files or injecting malware!!!
## Just to know
I got most of the code online just customizing and adding user input. Its made only for linux and i dont know is it going to be used on windows because nobody plays CTF-s on windows.
