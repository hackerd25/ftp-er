# FTP-er

FTP-er is a Python script for creating FTP servers.

## Purpose
FTP-er can be used for file transfers, CTFs, and various other purposes. However, please note that if you use it for illegal activities, I do not assume any responsibility.

## Usage
The program will prompt you for the required parameters during execution.

## Contribution
Anyone who collaborates and contributes to this code will become a part of Algh√òr1thm. We will develop security and penetration testing tools in a public repository. In the future, I may create a website for this project, but that i currently dont know.

## Warning!
Always exercise caution to prevent unauthorized access to your files or the injection of malware. Ensure that you do not forget about any servers you have running.

## Additional Information
Most of the code used in this project was sourced online. I customized it and added user input. Currently, the script is designed for Linux, and its compatibility with Windows is uncertain, as CTFs are typically not played on windows.
